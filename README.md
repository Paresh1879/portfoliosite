# ðŸ”— [portfolio-jirihofman.vercel.app](https://portfolio-jirihofman.vercel.app)

My personal website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), ~~[Upstash](https://upstash.com)~~ and deployed to preview(https://vercel.com/). Based on [chronark's site](https://chronark.com/).


## Running Locally


```sh-session
git clone https://github.com/jirihofman/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```


Create a `.env` file similar to [`.env.example`](https://github.com/jirihofman/profile/blob/main/.env.example).
```sh
mv .env.example .env.local
```
Add GITHUB_TOKEN into the new file.
```sh
GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_GH_TOKEN
```

Then install dependencies and run the development server:
```sh
# Install dependencies.
npm install
# Replace jirihofman's personal info with octocat's.
npm run setup
# Start hacking.
npm dev
```

Edit `data.json` to put your personal information there.


## Cloning / Forking

Please remove all of my personal information in `data.json` before deploying your own version of this site. This is done when you run `npm run setup`. Once you are happy with your `data.json`, set
```sh
# .env or .env.local
IS_TEMPLATE=false
```
in your ENVs to prevent `npm build` from reverting `data.json` back to Octocat's data.

### To check before deploying
- [ ] `data.json`: githubUsername, description, heroNames. Handled by `setup.mjs`.
- [ ] `README.md`: link at the top
- [ ] `app/layout.jsx`: metadata - title, description, favicon. Handled by `setup.mjs`.
- [ ] `public/favicon.ico`. Handled by `setup.mjs`.
